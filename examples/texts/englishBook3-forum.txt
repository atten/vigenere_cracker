 The Revelations of an Elite Family Insider
The Revelations of an Elite Family Insider

Something fascinating happened on a forum in a span of a few days and it has caused quite a stir in certain parts of the Internet. A person by the moniker of Insider claimed he was from a ruling bloodline and gave the people a chance to ask everything they wanted and Insider would answer.

At first it looks like another internet hoax, some lightweight questions were followed by lightweight answers, but then things started changing drastically. Anyone who understands dialectics knows that the answers Insider gave were designed to force/provoke others to ask questions which went to the core of the matter. First some questions are being asked by Insider like "Are you really living on the planet you think you are?" which made people react differently than before.

The answers this person started giving to those following questions showed a deep, broad understanding of philosophy, history, metaphysics, religion, magic, politics, and more in a way which is very innovative, detailed and some answers are thought provoking to say the least. What amazes is that Insider answered these questions in a very short time span and if you keep in mind that the topics are diverse, some indepth and some epic answers showed up literally minutes apart, one must wonder how it was done. Copy/paste from internet? I checked intensively and the sentences Insider used cannot be found on internet. Like one person observed, this was way over the heads of the usual suspects.

Some people started getting upset, others were drawn to it and this all lead to a dialogue where so much was revealed, including by the other posters that it can be studied for years to come.

Sounds hard to believe? Read on.

After the questioner asks him if he has had sex with a child the insider answers:
This question shows you read to much Icke who is a tool that is being used. But to answer, no.

Hm..

i agree when he says:

Quote:
Q: 
So the prison is an illusion right?

A: 
Of this prison is a "true illusion", get out then right now, I dare you.
You play the victim part.
You do not even accept you have free will, therefore you will always be ruled over, never prevail
here he seems to be reffering to the many people who are running around with the idea "I am imprisoned" or "this is an illusion"... 
while not doing anything about it.

this place is an illusion and we being our body is an illusion, 
but as long as you let yourself be the victim you will continue to experience yourself as a victim...

while in reality you are not a victim. never have been, never will be.
all power needed to free ourselves from our illusionary chains is available here and now if we want to.

Quote:
A:
"The most important thing for you, is to understand who you are and where you are"
yes, 
the way to free yourself from your chains is by knowing what is real and what is illusion.

the real you (the Self) is reality,
everything experienced by the 5 senses (the False Self/the Body) is illusion.

so the only way out of the illusion is to know reality. know your Self.

---------------------------------

interesting inteview.

he seem to make much sense in some of the things he says.
i read more than half, but i'll stop here because i don't really trust it for being the real truth.

maybe it is the real truth, maybe it is truth mixed with lies.
i suspect it is truth mixed with lies.

one example i find strange: 
he claims we are here to learn our lesson,
while all they seem to be doing is do everything they can to make sure we don't.
by creating false religion, etc.

Just starting to read but one question leapt out at me...

How do we know we live on the planet we think we do?

I then realised... I don't.

And can someone explain how this Q and A relate to each other?

Q: I´m curious to know why the Elite do not lead? They seem to be more of a parasite on society.

A: A fish in the ocean can´t see that birds are flying in the sky.


The shape of a Pyramid yes, but people forgot the underground chamber.
The Top of the Pyramid is not the top

There is no enemy you can attack except yourself.
If you are busy attacking something else, you are wasting precious energy and you will fail.
If you succeed, there will be no struggle anymore.

Knowing yourself and where you really are, are the 2 most important issues that you should be involved with.
It is your task to find out.

A question from me....
I downloaded all those .PDF's and they are all the same aren't they?
Also he gives answers and the questions aren't given. Is their a copy of the 'complete' thread available somewhere?

This 'You can't be told for your own good, you have to work it out' drives me nuts. It all seems so silly!

Another question...
Can anybody say that enlightenment/ascension/escape, IS worth it?

@rossus

please don't copy/paste these Q&A's incomplete.
Or you'll take the statement out of context as you have done in your post.


The complete Q&A:
Quote:
Q:
Worthy ....an interesting word. Are you expecting those of us who know about the world of polarity and try our best not to play the polarity game, to believe that we need to be worthy? In whose eyes? It can only be our own.
Whatever happened to the idea that ́the Universe is within us ́? Gaia and all other dimensional ́realities ́ are Illusions, No? So the prison is an illusion, right?
p.s. Baby, and btw, we DON ́T HAVE FREE WILL ON THIS PLANET....perhaps you slip is showing?
A:
Do you know who manufactured this new age nonsense you just promoted?
If this prison is a "true illusion", get out then right now, I dare you.
It is not like in the movies.
You play the victim part.
You do not even accept you have free will, therefore you will always be ruled over, never prevail and deserve everything you get according to universal laws.
The 5-sense has a very important function. It's function isn´t just illusion...

They create lies so we can learn to think for ourselves and not accept anybody else's reality as our own.

I recommend you are are wary of course of these revelations. But please read the entire pdf before having a conclusion on them.

Has anyone got any info about 'The Real Christ' Insider mentions, as oppose to Jesus of Nazareth. Had a quick search but nothing so far.

Q: Do you subcribe to the view,that our dualistic reality provides excellent opportunities for souls to develop unconditional love,so they may transcend our dialectic universe,rather than escaping from it?

A: It is the task of every soul to accomplish that while in this human shape.
There is a part that can be called escaping which will be followed by transcending....if failing, reincarnation.

Temperance will lead you to the rightful place from where it all starts.


My comment: The idea that parents are prison delivery systems, and there's a ready supply of inmates is a bit rich.

Don't blame your parents for you being here.

You yourself chose to be here...

That was extremely interesting and I indeed read the whole thing. This sounds a hell of a lot like the young 28 or 29 yr. old Rosthchild (David?) who wrote the global warming book for children (complete disinfo.) and was interviewed by Alex Jones where he said that the reason other planets (mercury or jupiter or whatever) are warming too is b/c they are closer to the sun than the earth.

Actually, I read most of it twice very carefully and thought about it very much. It really sent my head spinning on a few issues. Having slept on it, the biggest red flag that comes to my mind is where he tells people not to pay attention to world events b/c they are all completely orchestrated to distract you. Uhh... "sheep led to the slaughter" and "don't look at the man behind the curtain." come to mind.

As an earlier poster commented: Truth mixed with lies.

I'm curious to know why you posted in this forum as this is clearly spiritual material.

Q:
Why, oh why would an alleged member of an "elite family" waste one minute minute of their time, or
give credence to the cespool that is GLP?
A:
Bloodlines are not robots who all act the same.
You are confusing the ones who you think control you with others.
What is GLP?
